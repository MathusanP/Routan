# Routan — Privacy Policy  
*Last updated: October 2025*

---

## 1. Introduction  
This Privacy Policy explains how **Routan** (“the Bot”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and stores information when you interact with it on Discord.

Routan is an **open-source** project and may be run either as:  
- The **official hosted instance**, maintained by the developer(s); or  
- A **self-hosted instance**, deployed by other users under the same open-source license.

This policy applies **only to the official hosted instance**.  
If you are using a self-hosted version, the operator of that instance is responsible for its data handling.

---

## 2. Data We Collect  
Routan collects only minimal data necessary for its core features.  
We **do not** collect personal, sensitive, or identifiable information beyond what’s required for functionality.

### a. Automatically Processed (No Storage)
When you use most commands, Routan temporarily processes:
- Your **Discord User ID**
- Your **command input** 

This data is used *only* for that specific request and is **not saved**.

### b. Persistently Stored (For Features)
Some commands require limited, persistent storage. Examples include:

- Discord id's: Requred for core functionality for some commands that links them with commands.
- Confirmation Flags and dates: We record the date as to when user's have read the terms and conditions and privacy policy, users are not allowed to use some commands without confirming they've read them.
- Station / Bus stop preferences: Users are able to favourite a stop or a station as a quick dial. 

No other personally identifiable data (such as usernames, emails, or IP addresses) is collected or stored.

---

##  3. Data Retention  
- Stored data is retained **until you delete it** by requesting data removal.  
- Inactive or unused data may be periodically deleted.  
- You can request full deletion of your data at any time.

---

##  4. How Data Is Used  
Your stored data is used solely to:
- Provide personalised bot functionality (e.g. remembering your favourites).
- Verify consent to the Terms of Service.

We **do not**:
- Sell or share your data with third parties.  
- Use your data for analytics, advertising, or profiling.  
- Track activity outside Discord.

---

##  5. Data Security  
We take reasonable measures to protect data integrity, including:
- Restricted access to the database,  
- Secure connections for API requests,  
- Avoiding unnecessary logging of Discord data.

However, as with any online service, **absolute security cannot be guaranteed**.

---

##  6. Third-Party APIs  
Routan uses external APIs to fetch transport data, including:
- **Transport for London (TfL)** — for live transport and station data.  
- **Ordnance Survey (OS Maps)** — for geolocation and address lookup.

When you run a command such as `/nextbus`, your query may be sent to these APIs.  
These services have their own privacy policies, which Routan does not control.

---

##  7. Self-Hosted Instances  
If you host your own copy of Routan, you are solely responsible for:
- Any data you collect, store, or transmit.  
- Complying with Discord’s Developer Terms and privacy laws.

The maintainers of the official repository are **not responsible** for data collected by self-hosted instances.

---

##  8. Your Rights  
You have the right to:
- View what data Routan has stored about you,  
- Request deletion of your stored data,  
- Withdraw consent by removing confirmation or stopping use of the bot.

Requests can be made by contacting the maintainer directly at: mathuyt141@gmail.com

##  9. Updates to This Policy  
This policy may be updated occasionally to reflect new features or compliance changes.  
Major changes will be announced in the bot’s changelog or GitHub repository.
